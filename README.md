# COVID-19 Data Analysis with SQL

This project aims to analyze the COVID-19 pandemic using SQL queries. The goal is to gain insights into the spread of the virus, the impact on different countries, and the effectiveness of various interventions.

## Dataset

For this project, I used the "Data on COVID-19 (coronavirus) by Our World in Data" dataset, which can be accessed [here](https://github.com/owid/covid-19-data/tree/master/public/data). This dataset contains information on the number of cases, deaths, and vaccinations for each country and region, as well as information on demographics, health systems, and government policies.

## Analysis

I used SQL queries to explore the dataset and answer questions such as:

- Which countries have the highest number of cases or deaths?
- How has the number of cases changed over time in different regions?
- What is the correlation between vaccination rates and case numbers?
- How effective have different interventions been in controlling the spread of the virus?
