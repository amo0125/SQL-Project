# COVID-19 Data Analysis

This project analyzes data on the COVID-19 pandemic using the "Data on COVID-19 (coronavirus) by Our World in Data" dataset. The project consists of two parts:

- SQL data analysis: In this part, I used SQL queries to explore the dataset and answer questions about the pandemic.
- Tableau visualization: In this part, I created additional Tableau visualizations to provide insights into the pandemic.

## Dataset

The "Data on COVID-19 (coronavirus) by Our World in Data" dataset can be accessed [here](https://github.com/owid/covid-19-data/tree/master/public/data). The dataset contains information on COVID-19 cases, deaths, and vaccinations across different countries and regions.

## SQL Analysis

To perform the SQL data analysis, I used Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio. I wrote SQL queries to explore the dataset and answer questions about the pandemic. Some of the queries I used include:

- Which countries have the highest number of cases or deaths?
- How has the number of cases changed over time in different regions?
- What is the correlation between vaccination rates and case numbers?
- How effective have different interventions been in controlling the spread of the virus?

## Tableau Visualization

To create the Tableau visualizations, I used Tableau Public. The visualizations visualize the data and provide insights into the COVID-19 pandemic. The visualizations include:

- Percent Population Infected Per Country
- Global Numbers
- Total Deaths Count Per Continent
- Average Percent Population Infected By Quarter
- Percent Population Infected Per Continent
